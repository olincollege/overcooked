# Overcooked
A python implementation of the videogame Overcooked.
Final Project by Sophie Wu and Evelyn Kessler.

This project uses the pygame library, which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Install the library using pip install pygame before running this code.

## Installation Instructions
In order to install our game, first fork the main branch of this repository, then install pygame by running pip install pygame. Once you have done that, run python play_game.py and your pygame window will pop up. When you are done, press q to quit the game.

## How to Play

## Attribution
We used Figma to create our game board and our player’s sprites, along with the ‘Iconify’ plug in for the various icons.

We used pygame tutorials on opensource.com to get started, including; https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-framework-python, https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-python-add-a-player, and https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-python-moving-player.

We used the pygame library (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about), which is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, to visualize our game.
