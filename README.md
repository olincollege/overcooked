## Attribution
We used Figma to create our game board and our player’s sprites, along with the ‘Iconify’ plug in for the various icons.

We used pygame tutorials on opensource.com to get started, including; https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-framework-python, https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-python-add-a-player, and https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-python-moving-player.

We used the pygame library (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) to visualize our game.
