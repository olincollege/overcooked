# Overcooked for Dummies
Our project is a simplified version of the video game overcooked, implemented in python with the pygame library.

### Project Overview
The goal of our project was to recreate a simplified version of the video game 'Overcooked'. The original overcooked is a game where players try to create dishes to fulfill order tickets as fast as possible. If they go too fast and forget things, their food gets overcooked. In the real game there are many different stations, players can have dozens of things cooking or washing at a time, and the game increases in complexity the more the player plays. In our simplified version there are only eight stations; three ingredient stations, a cooking station, a plate station, a serve station, and a trash station. 

For each ticket, players must pick up a plate, fill the plate with the correct ingredients and serve the plate. If the plate contains a cooked item, the player also needs to get the raw ingredient from the ingredient station, drop the item off at the cooking station, and pick up to cooked item. The player engages with these actions using the AWSD or arrow keys to move around as well as the f key to pick up items and the e key to put down items. 

If a player serves a correct plate they make money; if they serve an incorrect plate or they need to trash the ingredients (such as if they pick up the wrong combination of ingredients), they lose money. Once the player serves the correct plate the ticket disappears and a new ticket appears in it's place. The player continues to fulfill tickets until they run out of time.
